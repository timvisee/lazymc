# Extras

Some extra steps and recommendations when using lazymc:

Before you use this in production, always ensure starting and stopping the
server works as expected by connecting to it once. Watch lazymc's output while
it starts and stops. If stopping results in errors, fix this first to prevent
corrupting world/user data.

Follow this repository with the _Watch_ button on the top right to be notified
